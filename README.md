# 🧠 RAG-Powered Multi-Agent Q\&A Assistant

This project is a multi-agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based assistant built as part of an internship assignment. It retrieves answers from local documents using vector search, intelligently routes queries to different tools, and generates natural language responses using a locally hosted LLM via [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

---

## 🎯 Objective

* ✅ Retrieve relevant information from short documents.
* ✅ Generate answers using a local LLM (Llama3 via Ollama).
* ✅ Route queries to specialized tools based on keywords.
* ✅ Provide a minimal CLI and Web UI for interaction.
* ✅ Log every decision and result.

---

## 🔧 Features

* 📄 **Document RAG** using FAISS + Sentence Transformers
* 🤖 **Local LLM Integration** via Ollama (`llama3`)
* 🧠 **Tool Routing** (Calculator, Dictionary, Wikipedia, RAG)
* 📊 **Logging** of tool usage and responses
* 🖥️ **Streamlit Web UI**
* 💻 **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com//RAG-Powered-Multi-Agent-Q-A-Assistant.git
cd RAG-Powered-Multi-Agent-Q-A-Assistant
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`:**

```
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-huggingface
langchain-ollama
faiss-cpu
sentence-transformers
PyDictionary
streamlit
ollama
```

### 3. Prepare Documents

Add 3–5 `.txt` files in the `data/` folder for ingestion.

### 4. Build the Vector Index

```bash
python ingest.py
```

This will chunk the documents and save a FAISS vector store in `faiss_index/`.

## 🚀 Running the Assistant

### Option 1: Web UI (Streamlit)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Enter your question in the input box.
* The agent selects the appropriate tool.
* Displays the answer (you can enhance to show tool name & context).

### Option 2: CLI Interface

```bash
python cli.py "Define empathy"
```

* Displays the answer in the terminal.
* Logs the tool used and result in `logs.txt`.

| `Define resilience`              | Dictionary |
| `Tell me about Python`           | Wikipedia  |
| `What are the company benefits?` | RAG (Docs) |

---

## 📝 Logs

Each query is logged in `logs.txt` in the following format:

```
Query: Define empathy
Used Tool: Dictionary
Result: Noun: the ability to understand others...
```
